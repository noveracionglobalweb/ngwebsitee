Introduction:

Generative AI is subset of Artificial Intelligence who has deepen its root over past few years.

Gen AI is a term used to describe the work or output that is produced artificially with help of AI

techniques without actually intervening the system. Gen AI is widely used term in recent years as it

provides advantage over traditional systems.

What is GENERATIVE AI?

Generative AI is system that is capable of producing new and original content on providing

some prompt. These systems are built over massive dataset, learning patterns and relationships in

data. Generative AI models once trained can generate various types and forms of output as needed.

Types of Gen AI:

Generative AI can be classified as per the results they produce. Majorly these models are

classified as below:

• Text Generation: In this type of model the system generates text on basis of the prompt

given. This text may be either analyzed or trained part of the system. Model is capable to

generate text on its own using algorithms and trained AI models. For example, on providing

prompt: “write a creative 1 line in Shakespeare's style of writing on "situation of today's

world". Following text is generated: “A world awash with turmoil, where hope and fear do

intertwine.”

Example for text generation: Open AI’s GPT-4, Google’s Gemini/Bard, Microsoft’s Copilot,

etc.

• Image Generation: This model is capable to generate or illustrate an image according to

given prompts. For example, if a prompt is given “ Generate an image of Human habitat

living and advancing on planet Neptune”. Following image is given as output

Example of Image Generation: Dall-E, Midjourney.• Audio Generation: These models are widely used for dubbing videos or to generate

animated movies. These models give further a softer hand to tune the audio in whatever

domain we need. They generate audios using the phonetics of the text provided. The models

are trained on actual voice of humans of various dialects, speech rate and spatial

uniqueness.

Example of Audio Generation: Tacotron, Whisper, Wavnet, etc.

• Video Generation: Video Generation is an advanced technique to generate video on basis of

single or series of prompts. These models are currently in under developing stage but are

capable to produce high end outputs.

Example of Video Generation: Imagen, Stable Diffusion Video, VQ-VAE-2

Difference between traditional AI/ML and generative AI:

Goal: GenAI is concentrated on generative tasks, whereas traditional AI/ML is mainly used for

predictive tasks.

Output: While GenAI generates fresh, original content, traditional AI/ML makes predictions and

insights based on data that already exists.

Applications: The field of generative AI is more diverse and includes fields like materials science, drug

development, and content creation.

Conclusion:

Generative AI is a major advancement in the field of artificial intelligence. Its capacity to produce

fresh, original content has the capability to transform whole markets as well as our way of living and

working. We can anticipate a future full of fascinating and cutting-edge possibilities as GenAI

develops further.
