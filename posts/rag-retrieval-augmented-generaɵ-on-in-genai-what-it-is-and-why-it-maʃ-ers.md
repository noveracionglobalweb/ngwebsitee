Current Technology and What is RAG?

GeneraƟ ve AI is a technology that everyone is using, but what makes Gen AI this popular?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented GeneraƟ on) is a technology which is used by Gen AI to build its answers

so accurate and qualitaƟ ve. So how does RAG work? As its name suggests it retrieves informaƟ on

from vast knowledgebase like books, websites or databases, and on basis of this knowledge the

informaƟ on is generated.

How RAG works?

RAG basically works in said manner as Retrieve the informaƟ on and generate response, but this

informaƟ on Retrieval process is done on vast amount of knowledgebase and the informaƟ on is

retrieved using techniques like semanƟ c analysis, keywords matching and vector search. The

generaƟ on task relies more onto NLP Techniques to formulate the words in Human Readable

understandable Language.

Why RAG MaƩ ers?

Retrieval Augmented GeneraƟ on maƩ ers because of its reliability. RAG provides answers on basis of

informaƟ on and it is not creaƟ ng any in conceptual informaƟ on by hallucinaƟ ng. Also, RAG has

increased the accuracy in GEN AI sector. RAG is being used in Text GeneraƟ on, SummarizaƟ on,

creaƟ ve wriƟ ng etc. RAG is a perfect example for text generaƟ on in Specific Styles. The text

generaƟ on in William Shakespeare’s English is an example of generaƟ ng text using RAG. Here the

model retrieves informaƟ on on Shakespeare’s content analyse it and generate creaƟ ve style text.

RAG is latest technology but it also has some drawbacks like if the informaƟ on retrieved from the

knowledgebase is incorrect or the informaƟ on is wrong in the database itself the response generated

will be incorrect. Also due to informaƟ on retrieval it is most important that privacy is maintained

about informaƟ on. Due to RAG confidenƟ ality and security comes to risk.

Benefits of RAG

RAG has become popular due to its accuracy in answers and has significantly reduced the chances of

hallucinaƟ on. RAG guarantees proof for answer or response it has generated informaƟ on on. It has

increased efficiency and has reduced Ɵme and made Gen AI more reliable. Rag currently is used in

many real-world applicaƟ ons like Customer Service Chatbot or any content creaƟ on services. RAG as

compared to tradiƟ onal text generaƟ on mechanism is more powerful. It has subject or domain

maƩ er experƟ se and can give excellent result. RAG has provided a beƩ er hand by allowing real Ɵme

updates in knowledgebase. Conclusion

In essence, RAG provides GEN AI capabiliƟ es to integrate retrieval mechanism. It overcomes many

tradiƟ onal approaches used for text generaƟ on. RAG provides accurate informaƟ on on learning from

underlying knowledgebase. It is useful for applicaƟ ons relying on real Ɵme informaƟ on, and scaling

and handling of huge amount of data. It has wide scope of applicaƟ ons and provides accurate and

relevant responses.
