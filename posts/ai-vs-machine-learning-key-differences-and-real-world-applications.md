The terms artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have come to represent innovation and the advancement of technology. Despite the common confusion between the names, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are two separate concepts with different approaches, uses, and implications. The main distinctions between AI and machine learning, as well as their practical uses and importance, will be discussed in this piece.



### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial intelligence is the imitation of human intelligence in machines. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are made to do activities like problem solving, language understanding, and decision-making that typically need human intelligence. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be broadly classified into two categories: Narrow AI, which can only perform certain tasks (such virtual assistants like Siri), and General AI, which can mimic human cognitive capabilities more broadly. But broad artificial intelligence is still only a theoretical idea.

A wide range of technologies are included in artificial intelligence (AI), such as computer vision, robots, and natural language processing (NLP). These systems are made to make decisions on their own without continual human input, learn from data, and get better over time.



### What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Artificial intelligence is a subset of machine learning. It involves developing algorithms that let computers gain knowledge from data. Machine learning, in contrast to artificial intelligence, is more concerned with patterns and forecasts. Without needing to be specifically created for every activity, machine learning enables systems to gradually improve their accuracy. For instance, depending on user behaviour and data patterns, a machine learning model applied to email filtering may identify emails as important or spam.

There are three major forms of machine learning:

* Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled data.
* Unsupervised Learning: The system identifies patterns in unlabeled data.
* Reinforcement Learning: The system learns by trial and error, receiving feedback to maximize rewards.



Key Differences Between AI and Machine Learning:Â 

1. Scope: While machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focusses on data-driven learning, AI as a word encompasses a variety of technologies and methodologies.
2. Objective: The main objective of AI is to develop intelligent agents that are capable of carrying out difficult tasks on their own. On the other hand, machine learning (ML) seeks to create algorithms that are able to learn from and forecast data.
3. Methods: While machine learning (ML) mostly uses statistical approaches to identify patterns in data, artificial intelligence (AI) uses a wide range of techniques, such as rule-based systems, genetic algorithms, and neural networks.
4. Learning Process:While AI systems might be rule-based or employ other techniques that don't always require learning, machine learning (ML) systems learn from data and get better over time.
