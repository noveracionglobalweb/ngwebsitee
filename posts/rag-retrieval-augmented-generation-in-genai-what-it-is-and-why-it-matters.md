Current Technology and What is RAG?

Generative AI is a technology that everyone is using, but what makes Gen AI this popular?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technology which is used by Gen AI to build its answers

so accurate and qualitative. So how does RAG work? As its name suggests it retrieves information 

from vast knowledgebase like books, websites or databases, and on basis of this knowledge the

information is generated.

How RAG works?

RAG basically works in said manner as Retrieve the information and generate response, but this

information Retrieval process is done on vast amount of knowledgebase and the information is

retrieved using techniques like semantic analysis, keywords matching and vector search. The

generation task relies more onto NLP Techniques to formulate the words in Human Readable

understandable Language.

Why RAG Matters?

Retrieval Augmented Generation matters because of its reliability. RAG provides answers on basis of

information and it is not creating any in conceptual information by hallucinating. Also, RAG has

increased the accuracy in GEN AI sector. RAG is being used in Text Generation, Summarization,

creative writing etc. RAG is a perfect example for text generation in Specific Styles. The text

generation in William Shakespeare’s English is an example of generating text using RAG. Here the

model retrieves information on Shakespeare’s content analyses it and generate creative style text.

RAG is latest technology but it also has some drawbacks like if the information retrieved from the

knowledgebase is incorrect or the information is wrong in the database itself the response generated

will be incorrect. Also due to information retrieval it is most important that privacy is maintained

about information. Due to RAG continentality and security comes to risk.

Benefits of RAG

RAG has become popular due to its accuracy in answers and has significantly reduced the chances of

hallucination. RAG guarantees proof for answer or response it has generated information on. It has

increased efficiency and has reduced time and made Gen AI more reliable. Rag currently is used in

many real-world applications like Customer Service Chatbot or any content creation services. RAG as

compared to traditional text generation mechanism is more powerful. It has subject or domain

matter expertise and can give excellent result. RAG has provided a better hand by allowing real time

updates in knowledgebase. Conclusion

In essence, RAG provides GEN AI capabilities to integrate retrieval mechanism. It overcomes many

traditional approaches used for text generation. RAG provides accurate information on learning from

underlying knowledgebase. It is useful for applications relying on real time information, and scaling

and handling of huge amount of data. It has wide scope of applications and provides accurate and

relevant responses.
